title: Microrobotic Setup GUI and Image-Based Control (Best Paper Award)
summary: I developed a closed loop image-based control approach for microrobots. In final stage, I decreased calculations by %80 from 120ms to 20ms, and I implemented in real time. Also, with my colleague, we developed a complete graphical user interface for a microrobotic setup that includes laser sensors, servo motors, linear motors, and scientific cameras.
